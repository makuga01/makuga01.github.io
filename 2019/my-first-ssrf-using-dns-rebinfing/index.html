<h1 id="what-is-dns-rebinding">What is DNS Rebinding?</h1>

<p>Imagine you are a comuter :D
People give you URLs and you load them</p>

<p>Of course you won&rsquo;t load url that points to your internal network&hellip; That would be stupid right?</p>

<p>Because of this some clever developer wrote code like this to prevent it from happening</p>

<p>To make explaining this easier</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>ip_banlist</code> is list of IPs you are blocking</p></li>

<li><p><code>domain</code> is the URL you are trying to fetch</p></li>

<li><p><code>getHostname</code> is a function that resolves a domain/URL to actual IP address or translates it from eg. octal to IPV4/6</p>

<pre><code>import requests
from core_funcs import getHostname
from banlists import ip_banlist

def secureFetch(domain):
  if getHostname(domain) not in ip_banlist:
    r = requests.get(domain)
    return r.text
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just bypass this&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash; <cite>a not so clever Developer</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="turns-out-i-actually-can">Turns out I actually can!</h2>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what DNS Rebinding is about!</p>

<h3 id="let-s-go-through-the-function-line-by-line">Let&rsquo;s go through the function line by line</h3>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s say the function is ran with <code>domain='http://wtf.geleta.eu'</code> and that the <code>ip_banlist = ['169.254.169.254', '127.0.0.1']</code></li>
<li>First it runs a DNS query with wtf.geleta.eu which returns 12.34.56.78 which is not in <code>ip_banlist</code> so our journey continues!!!</li>
<li>In the meantime the DNS record for wtf.geleta.eu magically changes to 127.0.0.1 ü¶πüèª‚Äç</li>
<li>now the request is made to <code>http://wtf.geleta.eu</code> so again somewhere in the <code>requests.get()</code> the dns query is ran again and now with DNS record changed to 127.0.0.1 Soooo there&rsquo;s nothing stopping us from retrieving localhost üéâüéâüéâ</li>
</ul>

<p>So that&rsquo;s the theory behind this whole thing. Pretty primitive right?</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-actually-need-to-make-this-happen">What do we actually need to make this happen</h2>

<ul>
<li>Since we can&rsquo;t manually change the dns record in milliseconds as the program runs, we need a custom DNS server configured to somehow figure out what IP should it resolve to and set TTL to 0 so no caching happens on the backend</li>
<li>Some &ldquo;interface&rdquo; to configure the domain - what should it resolve to, how many times, stuff like this</li>
<li>A fair bit of luck obviously</li>
</ul>

<p>When I found this bug I used <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html</a> but later on I figured out that it&rsquo;s not ideal, it only takes 2 IPs and resolves between them randomly so I have to send like 100 requests to get 1 that actually went to localhost :D</p>

<p>(This was about 7-8 months ago, I made my own tool for this. So expect little product placement at the end of the post!)</p>

<h1 id="how-it-went-down-with-the-actual-vulnerability">How it went down with the actual vulnerability</h1>

<p>I stumbled upon a service that I can configure to make a json request, set headers, etc. Then it gives me the http response</p>

<p>When i set the url to some internal/banned ip like <code>127.0.0.1</code> it gave me something like: <code>The request was blocked</code></p>

<p>After few hours of trying to bypass it I was like &ldquo;This is unbreakable, I&rsquo;m gonna get some food&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I got some food and minute after that I remembered that my friend <a href="https://masarik.sh" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan Masarik</a> did one challenge when we were hacking Fireshell CTF 2019 ctf with our <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/53880" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">CTF team</a> The challenge was about dns rebinding. Writeup: <a href="https://ctftime.org/writeup/13005" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ctftime.org/writeup/13005</a></p>

<p>The actual ctf challenge was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/Elber333" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">ELB</a> so If you are reading this I just want to say BIG thank you for making this challenge!</p>

<p>So I used the technique from writeup. I set the rebinding to 127.0.0.1/google ip and after sending 100 request with burp intruder 2 of them came back with different lenght than others, I click on one of them and see a html code with title which was name of the company</p>

<p>And I was like</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/1d44cb3dd69e88406e6e25bd70bbe9d6/tenor.gif" alt="" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>NO WAY!!!!! IT ACTUALLY FUCKING WORKED WTFFFFFF I&rsquo;M A 1337 HAXXXXXOR NOW</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/post_1/actually_ssrf.png" alt="" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>With dns rebinding confirmed, I didn&rsquo;t actually know what to do&hellip; Everything I have ever hacked before were just ctfs - and this is where the challenge usually ends, you have the flag and your are good to go</p>

<h2 id="it-doesn-t-work-that-well-irl">It doesn&rsquo;t work that well IRL</h2>

<p>Now all I had was some ssrf that I didn&rsquo;t know what I can use it for.</p>

<p>Few hours went by and there I was sending keybase message to <a href="https://masarik.sh" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan Masarik</a> because I was stuck again.
I told him that it was an amazon instance and he sent me some ip adress - 169.254.169.254 I clicked on it and nothing happened, that IP didn&rsquo;t exist
Then he told me that it is the aws metadata IP and if I can retrieve data from there, I basically own their whole aws (It wasn&rsquo;t completely true as you find out in a while but I was really really excited) I immediately fired up intruder and in few seconds I recieved a response with aws keys</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/post_1/aws_keys.png" alt="" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Now again I was like</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/6ebe33a366743280f76d14944244e82b/tenor.gif" alt="I love Pingu btw" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption">I love Pingu btw</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>And I love the ssrfs too!</p>

<h2 id="back-into-reality">Back Into reality</h2>

<p>Those were some trashy keys, I couldn&rsquo;t do almost anything with them&hellip;</p>

<p>Turns out I can only r/w some buckets but there weren&rsquo;t any useful, those that were hosted on frontend weren&rsquo;t writable (my favorite was the one with cookbooks - see screenshot) It made me laugh but I was disappointed. I tried to escalate my privs for another few hours and-or figure out what else could I do but there wasn&rsquo;t much of it :(</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/post_1/buckets.png" alt="" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Ok so the vuln had <em>some</em> Impact so I could report it. I set severity to P2
Now all left to do was enumerate and possibly get a RCE if I was lucky</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-a-week">Fast forward a week</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any response from the company,no fix, no lawsuit, nothing at all. Perhaps I should report it as P1. But whatever! It was good for me, I could enumerate more.</p>

<h3 id="aaaand-after-chaining-with-other-ssrf">AAAAND After chaining with other ssrf&hellip;</h3>

<p>This was a bit easier - there was a ftp connection vulnerable to ssrf - When some other service than ftp was passed in, let&rsquo;s say 127.0.0.1:22 server errored out with <code>Bad FTP RESPONSE: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_someversion</code> So using this I was able to enumerate open internal ports on their server
Another thing that was possible was bruteforcing ftp credentials on 127.0.0.1:21 since it was open too, I tried it with top-1k but it didn&rsquo;t work out :(</p>

<p>So I just enumerated the ports&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-another-few-hours">Fast forward another few hours</h2>

<p>I found a Monit Admin interface I was able to interact with via dns rebinding ssrf
It had an buffer overread vuln so I was able to read some memory (+1 point in impact :D)
Aaand I could shut down the whole instance using shutdown function in Monit (+10 points)</p>

<p>Then I reported this too!</p>

<h1 id="i-got-a-response-in-a-fucking-month">I got a response in a fucking month&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</h1>

<p>Meanwhile I turned into skeleton</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/e19bfdcad89ad9266a13aafa7d88f803/tenor.gif" alt="" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>But eventually they responded! They fixed it, gave me a not that big bounty (It&rsquo;s a small program), everyone was happy, life went on :D

<li><p>Bugs exist everywhere</p></li>

<li><p>I you are stuck, go back few steps and start again</p></li>

<li><p>If you are stuck after doing the step above - message your mentor/more expirienced hacker they will always help you</p></li>

<li><p>Be patient AF</p></li>

<li><p>If you have free time, create some great tool! or contribute to other great tools</p></li>

<li><p>BB is not entirely about money, It&rsquo;s more about the things you learn</p></li>

<h1 id="now-it-s-time-for-some-self-advertisment">Now it&rsquo;s time for some self-advertisment</h1>

<h2 id="are-you-tired-of-exploiting-dns-rebinding-without-gui">Are you tired of exploiting DNS Rebinding without gui?</h2>

<p>This may sound Scriptkiddie-ish but I actually wanted something with gui and logs</p>

<h3 id="how-it-went-down">How it went down</h3>

<p>I was on a vacation and I got sick probably from the food and I couldn&rsquo;t go out swimming. So I pulled out my laptop and started working on a Flask api connected to modified dns server via SQL and Redis&hellip; And I Can&rsquo;t forget the React frontend, It was the worst thing of it all. Sorry frontend fanboys, I just value my mental health.</p>

<p>After 1.5 days Everything except from the React app of course was done, You can actually check the code out <a href="https://github.com/makuga01/dnsFookup" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Here</a> and the Live Version with dns server and everything is <a href="http://rbnd.gl0.eu/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Here</a> - you can register, create rebind rules, use it to hack something, watch logs and stuff like that. Yes it&rsquo;s and http link I know that and I hate myself for that but I&rsquo;m too lazy to spend 2 minutes with certbot</p>

<p>For those who didn&rsquo;t look thamselves what it does is</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tell it to make a subdomain that will resolve to <code>1.2.3.4</code> 3 times and then to <code>127.0.0.1</code> 1 time</p></li>

<li><p>It puts the data into db and gives me something like <code>y1982ehiuwqh82319j2139821.gel0.space</code></p></li>

<li><p>when I make a query to this domain, dns server looks into db, loads the data into redis for quicker future access and then resolves it based on the rules given</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway thanks for reading! Hope you liked this writeup, If you have some questions/suggestions/you just wanna talk with some cringy script kiddie just DM me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marek_geleta" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">@marek_geleta</a> or anywhere else I will almost certainly respond to you in few minutes, I like talking to people üòÑ</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the amount of text/things learned I will get better I promise, I just like writing stories with incorrect grammar</p>
