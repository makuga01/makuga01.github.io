      <description>Unlike probably all web developers I love HTTP 500 errors - they often indicate that something went terribly wrong and there might be a vulnerability. In most cases, you are left with something like this
But in some, the errors are more verbose and sometimes disclose a little more information than they should about what&amp;rsquo;s actually happening behind the scenes and what went wrong. And this was the case with this bug.</description>

      <title>My First SSRF Using DNS Rebinding</title>

      <description>What is DNS Rebinding? Imagine you are a comuter :D People give you URLs and you load them
Of course you won&amp;rsquo;t load url that points to your internal network&amp;hellip; That would be stupid right?
Because of this some clever developer wrote code like this to prevent it from happening
To make explaining this easier
 ip_banlist is list of IPs you are blocking
 domain is the URL you are trying to fetch</description>
